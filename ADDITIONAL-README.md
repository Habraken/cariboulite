#Install CaribouLite with Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (Lite) (64bit)

My goal is to install the cariboulite on a Raspberry Pi0_2W and/or a Pi4. Requirements:  
- Connecetd to the Pi over etehernet and ultimately provide power to the Pi with POE  
- Use SDR++ server and SDR++  
- Use gnu-radio

All of the software fits on a sdcard of 16GByte. The CarubouLite uses SoapySDR as an hardware abstraction layer and needs to be installed as well. This can be done manually or automatically with the CaribouLite install script.

This 'recipe' was create and tested on a Pi0 and a Pi4 on May 1st 2025.  
 
###Initial steps
Download & install the latest version of PiOS using the Raspberry Pi Imager. Ensure that you have enabled ssh under services and that you have provided basic information to the general settings of the OS Customisation.  

I make the assumption that all of this is familiar to you and you know how to ssh over the local network to your Pi and know how to work with nano the text editor.

After you have logged on, update the Pi OS:

```
sudo apt upate
sudo apt upgrade
```
###Modifying the boot config.txt file
Modify the `/boot/firmware/config.txt` file to ensure the parameters are set so that the cariboulite can communicate with the CPU. The last two lines disable Bluetooth and WiFi, to minimise RF interference. So the Pi needs to be connected to the local network through an ethernet cable, else you can no longer communicate with the Pi after the next reboot. 

`sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt`

Add the lines below just above the line that reads:   
`# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)`

```
dtparam=i2c_arm=off
dtparam=spi=off

# CaribouLite
dtparam=i2c_vc=on
dtoverlay=spi1-3cs

# Disable WiFi and Bluetooth
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
dtoverlay=disable-bt
```

Save the file and reboot

###Install linux kernel header files:

```sudo apt install linux-headers-rpi-v8```
>Note: I think this step is only required if you want build SDR++.

###Monitoring the Pi's activity
The next steps will often take a while, during which you might want to periodically check that everything is still moving along.
In separate terminals watch what is going on during any of the following steps with `htop` and/or `dmesg`. This is how I discovered that `make` ran out of memory. 

```
htop
sudo dmesg -wH
```
###Install `git` & `cmake`

```
sudo apt install git cmake
```

#SoapySDR (optional)
If you want to have more control over where SoapySDR en SoapyRemote are installed, execute these steps first. If you use these steps, you should say `No` to the `install SoapySDR` question from the CaribouLite install script.

Create a directory where you want to keep your source code. I call mine: `src`. 

```
mkdir src && cd src
``` 

Get the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR.git
git clone https://github.com/pothosware/Soapyremote.git

```
Or:

```
git clone https://github.com/Habraken/SoapySDR.git
git clone https://github.com/Habraken/SoapyRemote.git
```
The following library is not available by default and SoapyRemakemote will complain but not fail:

```
sudo apt install libavahi-client-dev
```

In both repositories run the below commands to build and install SoapySDR and SoapyRemote starting with SoapySDR as SoapyRemote depends on it.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j`nproc`
sudo make install -j`nproc`
sudo ldconfig #needed on debian systems
SoapySDRUtil --info
```

#CaribouLite
Create a directory where you want to keep your source code. I call mine: `src`. 

```
mkdir src && cd src
``` 

Get the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/cariboulabs/cariboulite.git
```

Or if you don't want to patch yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/Habraken/cariboulite.git
```

Before you can install anything make the following three changes to `~/src/cariboulite/driver/smi_stream_dev.c`.

```
cd ~/src/cariboulite/driver
sudo nano smi_stream_dev.c
```

Add this include statement near the other include statements: `#include <linux/vmalloc.h>`

Then Hit Ctl+W and type `‘create sysfs’` and change the line with the `-` in front to the line with the `+` in front.

```
// Create sysfs entries with "smi-stream-dev"
-smi_stream_class = class_create(THIS_MODULE, DEVICE_NAME);
+smi_stream_class = class_create(DEVICE_NAME);
```

Then Hit Ctl+W and type ‘smi_stream_dev_remove’ and change the line with the - in front to the line with the + in front and remove the return statement with the - in front.

```
*   smi_stream_remove - called when the driver is unloaded.
*
***************************************************************************/
 
-static int smi_stream_dev_remove(struct platform_device *pdev)
+static void smi_stream_dev_remove(struct platform_device *pdev)
 {
     //if (inst->reader_thread != NULL) kthread_stop(inst->reader_thread);
     //inst->reader_thread = NULL;	
     
     device_destroy(smi_stream_class, smi_stream_devid);
     class_destroy(smi_stream_class);
     cdev_del(&smi_stream_cdev);
     unregister_chrdev_region(smi_stream_devid, 1);
 
     dev_info(inst->dev, DRIVER_NAME": smi-stream dev removed");
-    return 0;
 }
```

In the `cariboulite/driver` directory:

```
./install.sh install
```

Then in the cariboulite directory:

```
./install.sh
```
This takes ‘a while’ on a Pi0. At a certain point the script will ask if you want to `install SoapySDR`, if you did not install it before. Say `Yes`. After the script has completed, reboot the Pi. Now we need to check with SMI driver is working correctly.

```
lsmod | grep smi
```
The ouput should look like this:

```
pi@pi0b-bookworm:~ $ lsmod | grep smi
smi_stream_dev         16384  0
bcm2835_smi            20480  1 smi_stream_dev
pi@pi0b-bookworm:~ $ 
```
Also check if the permissions are set correclty:

```
ls -l /dev/smi
```
the ouput shoudl look like this:

```
pi@pi0b-bookworm:~ $ ls -l /dev/smi
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 239, 0 May  1 13:40 /dev/smi
pi@pi0b-bookworm:~ $ 
```

###Testing SoapySDR

As SoapySDR was install by the install script of cariboulite it should be possible to communicate with the CaribouLite.

```
SoapySDRUtil --find
``` 
The ouput should look like this:

```

>~~~This is caused by the Pi0 not being able to handle 4 MSPS. During the configuration of SoapyRemote or SDR++ server we shall change this to 2 MSPS.~~~ 

>I have just discovered that this behaviour is in fact due to a defective cariboulite board. It appears to function normally until you try to start the smi stream. Wait on feedback fromCaribouLabs. (May 1st 2025)

> Also the Pi0 can do 4 MSPS if the data type is set CS8 instead of CS16 or CF32.   

###Increase the swapfile size
During the SDR++ build `make` ran out of memory. Hence I increased the swap file from 512 to 1024.

```
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff  
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile 
```
Chnage the line `CONF_SWAPSIZE=512` to `CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024`. Save the file.

```
sudo dphys-swapfile setup
sudo dphys-swapfile swapon  
```

Or:

```
sudo reboot
```
#SDR++

Install dependencies for SDR++:

```
sudo apt install libglfw3 // maybe  not needed.
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
sudo apt install libfftw3-dev
sudo apt install libvolk2-dev
sudo apt install libzstd-dev
sudo apt install librtaudio-dev
```

or in one go:

```
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libfftw3-dev libvolk2-dev libzstd-dev librtaudio-dev

```
### Install via the nightly build package

The easiest method is to download and install the nightly builds of SDR++. First download the package:

```
curl https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus/releases/download/nightly/sdrpp_debian_bookworm_aarch64.deb
```

Then run the following:

```
sudo apt install ~/Downloads/sdrpp_debian_bookworm_aarch64.db
```

### Build from source

Get the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus.git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/Habraken/SDRPlusPlus.git
```
In the `~/src/SDRPlusPLus` directory:

```
mkdir build && cd build
```

```
cmake  -DOPT_BUILD_SOAPY_SOURCE=ON -DOPT_BUILD_HERMES_SOURCE=ON -DOPT_BUILD_PLUTOSDR_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_AIRSPY_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_AIRSPYHF_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_HACKRF_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_RTL_SDR_SOURCE=OFF ..
```

```
make -j2
```

```
cd ..
```
```
sh ./create_root.sh
```
```
cd build
```
```
sudo make install
```
```
sudo ldconfig
```


>Note: There is no need to start the SoapySDR service! Instead we will use the SDR++ Server. For gnu-radio the Soapy server is needed though...

###Desktop version SDR++
Before the `soapy_source` is available it needs to be added, in the ‘Module Manager’ of SDR++ if you are running the desktop app on the Pi4. In the 'module manager' select ‘soapy_source’, add a name to the left e.g. ‘Soapy Source’ and click on the tiny plus sign on the right…

Or...

###Headless version SDR++
If you are working from the cli you need to first run SDR++ so that the default config files are created.

```
sdrpp --server
```
Hit ^c to stop the server again.

Edit the `~/.config/sdrpp/config.json` and add the soapy_source module:

```
        ,
        "Soapy Source": {
            "enabled": true,
            "module": "soapy_source"
        }
```

>Note: mind the comma above the double quote!

Save the file and start the SDR++ server.

```
sdrpp --server
```
When the server starts watch the cli output and confirm that the 'Soapy Source' is loaded.

On your remote computer you should now start SDR++ and select SDR++ Server as Source. Provide the correct IP address of the Pi running the SDR++ server. Press `Connect`. At the `Source [REMOTE]` use the drop down menu to select `SoapySDR`. You ay have to press the `Refresh` button first. In the dropdown menu below that make sure you select the device appropriate for your selected frequency.

>Observations: The Pi4 can easily handle 4 MSPS but somehow when the `bandwidth` setting is set to `auto` there is no data coming from the radio. When the bandwidth setting is changed to 2 MHz data is streaming again. However the display bandwidth is 4 MHz!
>The analog bandwidth is only 2.5 MHz according to the datasheet. With `SoapySDRUtil --probe` you'll find a max. sample rate = 4 MSPS and the max. filter bandwidth = 2 MHz.
