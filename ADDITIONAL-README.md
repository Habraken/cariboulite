# Additional CaribouLite notes

Development priorities and acceptance criteria are tracked in the
[development roadmap](ROADMAP.md). The [documentation audit](docs/documentation-audit-2026-09-16.md) records what
was checked and what remains open. These installation notes
combine historical recipes and work in progress; they are not a freshly verified
installation guide. Before applying manual source patches, check whether the
current checkout already contains them. For recorded development state, see the
[software baseline](docs/software-baseline-2026-09-13.md) and
[FPGA study](docs/fpga-gap-study-2026-09-13.md); neither certifies the current setup.

# Install CaribouLite with Raspberry pi OS Trixie (64bit) [WIP]
These Trixie notes are a historical workaround and need revalidation against the
current kernel, login/session limits and driver permissions. A Debian-wide policy
change has not been established here. The settings below change system-wide
locked-memory limits; they do not by themselves establish device access or
real-time scheduling permissions.

## Step 1
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system.conf.d
```
```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system.conf.d/99-memlock.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[Manager]
DefaultLimitMEMLOCK=infinity
EOF
```
## Step 2
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/user.conf.d
```
```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/user.conf.d/99-memlock.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[Manager]
DefaultLimitMEMLOCK=infinity
EOF
```
## Step 3
```bash
sudo reboot
```
## Step 4
```bash
ulimit -l
cat /proc/self/limits | grep -i "Max locked memory"
```

# Install CaribouLite with Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (Lite) (64bit)

My goal is to install the cariboulite on a Raspberry Pi0_2W and/or a Pi4. Requirements:
- Connected to the Pi over ethernet and ultimately provide power to the Pi with POE
- Use SDR++ server and SDR++
- Use gnu-radio

The recorded setup fit on a 16 GB SD card; current disk requirements need
remeasuring. SoapySDR is required for Soapy-based applications, while the core
library can build without it. The installer can build SoapySDR when missing.

This recipe was recorded as tested on a 'Pi0' and Pi4 on May 1st 2025.
The exact Zero model needs clarification: a 64-bit recipe does not establish
compatibility with the original Zero/Zero W. Platform validation is DOC-01.

### Initial steps
Download & install the latest version of PiOS using the Raspberry Pi Imager. Ensure that you have enabled ssh under services and that you have provided basic information to the general settings of the OS Customisation.

I make the assumption that all of this is familiar to you and you know how to ssh over the local network to your Pi and know how to work with nano the text editor.

After you have logged on, update the Pi OS:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
### Modifying the boot config.txt file
Modify the `/boot/firmware/config.txt` file to ensure the parameters are set so that the cariboulite can communicate with the CPU. The last two lines disable Bluetooth and WiFi, to minimise RF interference. So the Pi needs to be connected to the local network through an ethernet cable, else you can no longer communicate with the Pi after the next reboot.

`sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt`

Add the lines below just above the line that reads:
`# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)`

```
dtparam=i2c_arm=off
dtparam=spi=off

# CaribouLite
dtparam=i2c_vc=on
dtoverlay=spi1-3cs

# Disable WiFi and Bluetooth
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
dtoverlay=disable-bt
```

Save the file and reboot

### Install linux kernel header files:

The SMI kernel driver needs headers matching the running kernel. Check:

```sh
uname -r
ls -ld "/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build"
```

Use the package for your installed kernel and architecture; `linux-headers-rpi-v8`
was the package used for the recorded 64-bit Pi setup. This is a driver-build
requirement, not an SDR++ requirement. See the
[Raspberry Pi kernel documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html).

### Monitoring the Pi's activity
The next steps will often take a while, during which you might want to periodically check that everything is still moving along.
In separate terminals watch what is going on during any of the following steps with `htop` and/or `dmesg`. This is how I discovered that `make` ran out of memory.

```
htop
sudo dmesg -wH
```
### Install `git` & `cmake`

```
sudo apt install git cmake
```

# SoapySDR (optional)
If you want to have more control over where SoapySDR en SoapyRemote are installed, execute these steps first. If you use these steps, you should say `No` to the `install SoapySDR` question from the CaribouLite install script.

Create a directory where you want to keep your source code. I call mine: `src`.

```
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
```

Get the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR.git
git clone https://github.com/pothosware/SoapyRemote.git

```
Or:

```
git clone https://github.com/Habraken/SoapySDR.git
git clone https://github.com/Habraken/SoapyRemote.git
```
The following library not available by default and SoapyRemote will complain but not fail:

```
sudo apt install libavahi-client-dev
```

In both repositories run the below commands to build and install SoapySDR and SoapyRemote starting with SoapySDR as SoapyRemote depends on it.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_PYTHON3=ON
make -j`nproc`
sudo make install -j`nproc`
sudo ldconfig #needed on debian systems
SoapySDRUtil --info
```

# CaribouLite
Create a directory where you want to keep your source code. I call mine: `src`.

```
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
```

Get the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/cariboulabs/cariboulite.git
```

Or if you don't want to patch yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/Habraken/cariboulite.git
```

To make the nbfm_tx and nbfm_rx examples work you also need to install the dev tools for ALSA:

```
sudo apt install -y libasound2-dev pkg-config
```

### Current checkout versus historical patches

The current `driver/smi_stream_dev.c` already includes `<linux/vmalloc.h>`,
uses `class_create(DEVICE_NAME)`, and declares `smi_stream_dev_remove` as `void`.
Do not apply the old three-step kernel patch again. NBFM and modem-monitor code
are already in this checkout; switching to `feature/nbfm_rx` is not an
installation prerequisite.

The top-level installer builds the blob generator before the driver and invokes
the driver installer itself; a driver-first installation is unnecessary. It also
runs `git pull`, installs packages and writes system configuration. Its legacy
header/Python package choices still require fresh Bookworm/Trixie validation;
see [DOC-01](ROADMAP.md#documentation-validation-backlog).

Then in the cariboulite directory:

```
./install.sh
```
This takes ‘a while’ on a Pi0. At a certain point the script will ask if you want to `install SoapySDR`, if you did not install it before. Say `Yes`.

After the script has completed, reboot the Pi.
```
sudo reboot
```

Now we need to check whether the SMI driver is working correctly.

```
lsmod | grep smi
```
The ouput should look like this:

```
pi@pi0b-bookworm:~ $ lsmod | grep smi
smi_stream_dev         16384  0
bcm2835_smi            20480  1 smi_stream_dev
pi@pi0b-bookworm:~ $
```
Also check if the permissions are set correclty:

```
ls -l /dev/smi
```
the ouput shoudl look like this:

```
pi@pi0b-bookworm:~ $ ls -l /dev/smi
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 239, 0 May  1 13:40 /dev/smi
pi@pi0b-bookworm:~ $
```

### Testing SoapySDR

As SoapySDR was install by the install script of cariboulite it should be possible to communicate with the CaribouLite.

```
SoapySDRUtil --find
```
The ouput should look like this:

```

Menu option 3 programs `firmware/top.bin` relative to the working directory.
Run the app from the repository root, and distinguish this file from firmware
embedded in a built library. Startup behavior and the image actually running
must be checked rather than inferred from the branch name. The historical
[baseline](docs/software-baseline-2026-09-13.md) records Jan's startup and
programming procedure, with its validation limits.

Options 12 and 14 need configured ALSA playback. In the current option 14
configuration, TX captures `plughw:Loopback,1,1`, RX plays to
`plughw:Loopback,0,0`, and both default to 430.100 MHz. `tone_mode` defaults to
false; the internal tone parameter is 600 Hz. Therefore pressing T does not
by itself select the historical 650 Hz tone. Audio/device and RF parameters
remain hardcoded (roadmap items 2 and 5).

This is how the monitor modem status output should look like:
```

# Modifying the firmware (FPGA)

The current build uses Yosys, nextpnr-ice40 and IceStorm's `icepack`;
Arachne-PNR is not used by `firmware/Makefile`. Follow the
[firmware build instructions](firmware/README.md#building-firmware-reliably)
for tool requirements, generated headers, timing checks and failure handling.
The older Ubuntu 14.04/Fedora 24 dependency lists have been retired because they
do not establish a reproducible Bookworm/Trixie toolchain.

For building nextpnr itself, follow its
[upstream instructions](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr/blob/main/README.md).
Keep the configure and build directories consistent (`cmake -S . -B build ...`
followed by `cmake --build build`). Record tool versions with hardware results.

From the repository root, after the required tools and blob generator exist:

```sh
make -C firmware build
```

This builds the bitstream and generated headers, without programming the board.
Rebuild the userspace library if you need it to embed the new image. To program
the file through menu option 3, run `./build/cariboulite_test_app` from the
repository root. Avoid `make clean` as a routine prerequisite: it removes local
artifacts, including a potentially useful previously validated image.

# SDR++

### Increase the swapfile size (Pi Zero only?)
During the SDR++ build `make` ran out of memory (on the Pi Zero?). Hence I increased the swap file from 512 to 1024.

```
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
```
Change the line `CONF_SWAPSIZE=512` to `CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024`. Save the file.

```
sudo dphys-swapfile setup
sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
```

Or:

```
sudo reboot
```

Install dependencies for SDR++:

```
sudo apt install libglfw3 # runtime library
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
sudo apt install libfftw3-dev
sudo apt install libvolk-dev # confirm package name for your OS
sudo apt install libvolk-bin
sudo apt install libzstd-dev
sudo apt install librtaudio-dev
```

or in one go:

```
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libfftw3-dev libvolk-dev libvolk-bin libzstd-dev librtaudio-dev

```
### Install via the nightly build package

Use the [upstream SDR++ installation instructions](https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus#installing)
to select an artifact matching the OS and CPU architecture. The previous
hardcoded nightly URL has not been revalidated. Install the downloaded `.deb`
with `sudo apt install ./actual-package-name.deb` from its download directory.
The old recipe used `.db` by mistake and did not save the `curl` output to a file.

### Build from source

Install the development dependencies for the modules you enable. SoapySDR device
discovery (`SoapySDRUtil --find`) is a runtime check, not a prerequisite for
CMake to discover its development libraries. Confirm module availability in the
configure output. The commands below are the recorded source-build recipe;
a fresh build and server configuration check remain DOC-07.

Get the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus.git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/Habraken/SDRPlusPlus.git
```
In the `~/src/SDRPlusPlus` directory:

```
mkdir build && cd build
```

```
cmake .. -DOPT_BUILD_SOAPY_SOURCE=ON -DOPT_BUILD_HERMES_SOURCE=ON -DOPT_BUILD_SDRPLAY_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_PLUTOSDR_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_AIRSPY_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_AIRSPYHF_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_HACKRF_SOURCE=OFF -DOPT_BUILD_RTL_SDR_SOURCE=OFF
```

```
make -j2
```

```
cd ..
```
```
sh ./create_root.sh
```
```
cd build
```
```
sudo make install
```
```
sudo ldconfig
```


> SDR++ Server and SoapyRemote are separate network interfaces. Local GNU Radio access through the native source or local SoapySDR does not require a SoapyRemote server. A remote Soapy connection requires the corresponding server on the radio host.

### Desktop version SDR++
Before the `soapy_source` is available it needs to be added, in the ‘Module Manager’ of SDR++ if you are running the desktop app on the Pi4. In the 'module manager' select ‘soapy_source’, add a name to the left e.g. ‘Soapy Source’ and click on the tiny plus sign on the right…

Or...

### Headless version SDR++
If you are working from the cli you need to first run SDR++ so that the default config files are created.

```
sdrpp --server
```
Hit ^c to stop the server again.

Edit the `~/.config/sdrpp/config.json` and add the soapy_source module:

```
        ,
        "Soapy Source": {
            "enabled": true,
            "module": "soapy_source"
        }
```

>Note: mind the comma above the double quote!

Save the file and start the SDR++ server.

```
sdrpp --server
```
When the server starts watch the cli output and confirm that the 'Soapy Source' is loaded.

On your remote computer you should now start SDR++ and select SDR++ Server as Source. Provide the correct IP address of the Pi running the SDR++ server. Press `Connect`. At the `Source [REMOTE]` use the drop down menu to select `SoapySDR`. You ay have to press the `Refresh` button first. In the dropdown menu below that make sure you select the device appropriate for your selected frequency.

>Observations: The Pi4 can easily handle 4 MSPS but somehow when the `bandwidth` setting is set to `auto` there is no data coming from the radio. When the bandwidth setting is changed to 2 MHz data is streaming again. However the display bandwidth is 4 MHz!
>The analog bandwidth is only 2.5 MHz according to the datasheet. With `SoapySDRUtil --probe` you'll find a max. sample rate = 4 MSPS and the max. filter bandwidth = 2 MHz.

I have also tried all the other options such as hard reset of the fpga, soft reset of the fpga, reprogramming of the fpga. During the receive test there are always smi sync errors.

# ALSA

ALSA is complicated. To have some flexibility for testing the nbfm modulator and demodulator it can be helpfull to not have to depend on a physical audio device, such as a sound card.This can be done with a ALSA utility: snd_aloop. What I describe here is based on this article:

based on: https://linuxvox.com/blog/linux-without-hardware-soundcard-capture-audio-playback-and-record-it-to-file/

### Prerequisites:

Ensure
```alsa-utils```  ```ffmpeg``` ```sox```
are installed.

note :both alsa-utils and ffmpeg, are already part of the Raspberry OS usualy.

### Making the Loopback Module Persistent

The modprobe command loads the module temporarily (it will unload on reboot). To make it persistent:

Create a configuration file in /etc/modules-load.d/ to load the module at boot:

sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/alsa-loopback.conf
Add the following line and save the file:

```snd-aloop```
Reboot to test persistence (optional, but recommended):

sudo reboot
After reboot, re-run lsmod | grep snd_aloop to confirm the module is loaded.

### Testing TX

To test if the ALSA Loopback device works you can start the cariboulite_test_app, enable tx and in a separate terminal run the following command: ```speaker-test -D plughw:Loopback,0,1 -c 1 -t sine -f 440 -r 48000```. You should now here a 440 Hz tone on a narrow band fm receiver tuned to the correct frequency.

If you want to route the microphone audio of your USB audio device to the caribloulite instead of a test tone, you can use this command: ```arecord -D plughw:4,0 -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 48000 | aplay  -D plughw:Loopback,0,1 -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 48000```.

For some obscure reason the alsaloop command doesn't work for this route.

### Testing RX

Similary you can test rx with the following command to 'route' the audio signal from the Loopback device to the plugged in sound card: ``` arecord -D plughw:Loopback,1,0 -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 48000 | aplay  -D plughw:4,0 -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 48000```.

If faced with ```overruns!!!``` one could also use:

```alsaloop -C plughw:Loopback,1,0 -P plughw:4,0 -r 48000 -c 1 -f S16_LE -t 50000```

or

```arecord -D plughw:Loopback,1,0 -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 48000 --buffer-time=100000 --period-time=25000 | aplay  -D plughw:4,0 -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 48000 --buffer-time=100000 --period-time=25000```



# GNU-RADIO (WIP)
```
sudo apt install gnuradio
```


Installing GNU Radio alone does not install this repository's native block.
`software/gr-caribouLite/CMakeLists.txt` requests GNU Radio 3.10 and its `lib/`
subdirectory looks up installed `cariboulite` through pkg-config. The tree has
`caribouLiteSource_impl.cc` and a source GRC definition, but no native TX sink.
SoapySDR has a separate TX/RX adapter. Working flowgraphs, current dependency
validation and TX/RX hardware checks remain under roadmap item 9 and DOC-07.
