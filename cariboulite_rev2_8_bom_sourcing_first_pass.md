# CaribouLite Rev 2.8 Full — BOM sourcing first pass

**Date checked:** 2026-09-12  
**Source BOM:** `cariboulite_bom.xlsx` from the public CaribouLite Rev 2.8 production package  
**Build assumption:** 5 assembled Full boards  
**Reproduction policy:** For the first reproduction run, use the **exact BOM manufacturer part number (MPN)**. No engineering substitutions are approved in this document. Where the BOM itself lists multiple acceptable MPNs, those are treated as original-design alternatives.

## Status legend

- 🟢 **Stocked / Active / Listed** — no immediate sourcing concern found.
- 🟡 **Verify** — exact MPN needs a fresh distributor check before ordering, but no confirmed showstopper yet.
- 🟠 **Attention** — backorder, revised ordering code, long lead time, or exact stock issue.
- 🔴 **High risk** — exact BOM MPN is obsolete or otherwise a clear reproduction risk.

## Immediate procurement flags

1. **`0402CS-5N6XGLW` (L3)** — the exact Coilcraft 5.6 nH RF inductor is marked **Obsolete** by Mouser. This is the clearest exact-reproduction problem found so far. Because it is an RF matching component, we should not silently replace it with a same-value inductor.
2. **`ATX-12-F-26.000MHz-F05-T` (U3)** — exact production TCXO. Supply is tighter than most of the BOM and this part is clock-critical. Secure exact devices from a traceable source before PCB assembly.
3. **`TC1-1-13M+` (U23)** — Active, but DigiKey currently has zero stock. Check Mini-Circuits direct and other authorized distribution.
4. **`2450FB15A050E` (U2) and `0896BM15E0025E` (U4)** — Johanson has revised the ordering numbers. We need written/data-sheet confirmation that the new global MPNs are electrically, mechanically, and process-identical before treating them as exact-reproduction parts.
5. **`ICE40LP1K-QN84` (U16)** — available now, but factory lead time is long. Buy prototype quantity early.
6. **`MMBT3904,215` (U27/U28)** — exact Nexperia code is Active but presently out of stock at the main distributors checked. This is electrically non-critical compared with the RF path, but the first-build policy still says no substitutions.

## RF / clock parts that should be frozen to exact MPN

For the initial reproduction, the following deserve an explicit **DO NOT SUBSTITUTE** note to Eurocircuits even if their BOM tool proposes equivalents:

`0402N2R2B500CT`, `0402N1R8B500CT`, `GCM1555C1HR80WA16D`, `0402N150J500CT`, `0402N181F500CT`, `04025A8R2BAT2A`, `0402CS-5N6XGLW`, `AT86RF215-ZU`, `2450FB15A050E`, `ATX-12-F-26.000MHz-F05-T`, `0896BM15E0025E`, `MAAM-011229`, `LFCN-2250+`, `SKY13373-460LF`, `HFCN-2275+`, `CG2164X3-C2`, `CG2409X3-C2`, `TC4-19G2+`, `RFFC5072TR13`, `TC1-1-13M+`, and `SG-8018CG 125.0000M-TJHSA3`.

## Overall first-pass conclusion

The Rev 2.8 BOM still looks **buildable**, but the sourcing problem has narrowed to a small set of exact-MPN issues rather than the major RF ICs. The AT86RF215, RFFC5072, iCE40 FPGA, MACOM amplifiers, Skyworks switches, Mini-Circuits filters/transformer, regulators, EEPROM, and many passives remain obtainable. The next sourcing work should concentrate first on the obsolete Coilcraft inductor, the exact Abracon TCXO, the TC1-1-13M+ balun, the two Johanson revised MPNs, and any remaining rows marked Verify.
