# EEPROM
Each CaribouLite is pre-configured by the contract manufacturer before shipping. The Full and the ISM versions are further distinguishable by the configuration resistors placed on the back side of the board (marked as "**CFG/1234**").

CaribouLite doesn't have an FPGA configuration flash device, as the ICE40 device is dynamically configured by the RPI quickly and on-demand. It rather has a general board configuration device (EEPROM) as required by RPi's HAT device rules.

## EEPROM Data Structure
The code is located [here](../../software/libcariboulite/src/hat/) and is based on [RPi EERPROM Utils Tools](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats/tree/master/eepromutils) provided by RaspberryPi. The ID EEPROM internal structure is described [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats/blob/master/eeprom-format.md).

The general structure is as follows:
1. **HEADER**: containing a valid header key (SIGN), its version, the number of ATOMs that follow the header and the total size of the EEPROM contents.
2. **VENDOR INFO**: Product information and Vendor information, and the product UID (unique 128bit identifier / serial number).
3. **GPIO MAP**: a listing of CaribouLite's RPi GPIO states and flags, for each GPIO pin (GPIO2-GPIO27).
4. **DEVICE TREE**: as the system is booting, the RPi kernel automatically reads this ATOM from the EEPROM and sets it as an overlay. As a result, the kernel modules needed for CaribouLite to operate (SMI, SPI, etc.) are probed on startup and configured according to the overlay.
5. **PROPRIETARY DATA**: historically proposed for IQ, TX-power and reference-clock calibration and GPIO/PMOD settings. The populated layout and calibration use are not established by this guide; validation remains DOC-05.

## Gracefully Accessing Data
To access the EEPROM data, one can use our code which also validates and decodes the information. The easier way to access the information within the programmed EEPROM is to use the boot-time device-tree view under `/proc/device-tree` as follows:

```
cd /proc/device-tree/hat/

# name
cat name

# product: "CaribouLite RPI Hat"
cat product

# product_id: "0x0001"
cat product_id

# product_ver: "0x0001"
cat product_ver

# uuid: "AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEEEE" GUID format
#       which is also the board's raw serial number
cat uuid

# vendor: "CaribouLabs.co"
cat vendor
```

## Reprogramming the EEPROM
The implementation is under [hat](../../software/libcariboulite/src/hat/) and
[cariboulite_production.c](../../software/libcariboulite/src/cariboulite_production.c).
This README does not yet provide a validated programming command. Backup/restore,
board identity fields, write protection and readback verification are tracked as
[DOC-05](../../ROADMAP.md#documentation-validation-backlog). Do not substitute
FPGA programming for EEPROM programming; they target different devices.
