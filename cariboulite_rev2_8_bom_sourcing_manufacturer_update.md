# CaribouLite Rev 2.8 Full — BOM sourcing & manufacturer-direct update

**Date checked:** 2026-09-12  
**Revision:** Manufacturer-direct and private-purchaser sourcing added  
**Source BOM:** `cariboulite_bom.xlsx` from the public CaribouLite Rev 2.8 production package  
**Build assumption:** 5 assembled Full boards  
**Reproduction policy:** For the first reproduction run, use the **exact BOM manufacturer part number (MPN)**. No engineering substitutions are approved in this document. Where the BOM itself lists multiple acceptable MPNs, those are treated as original-design alternatives.

## Status legend

- 🟢 **Stocked / Active / Listed** — no immediate sourcing concern found.
- 🟡 **Verify** — exact MPN needs a fresh distributor check before ordering, but no confirmed showstopper yet.
- 🟠 **Attention** — backorder, revised ordering code, long lead time, or exact stock issue.
- 🔴 **High risk** — exact BOM MPN is obsolete or otherwise a clear reproduction risk.

## Manufacturer-direct and private-purchaser findings

The manufacturer-level check materially improves the sourcing outlook. No critical RF silicon checked so far appears restricted to corporate purchasers, and several manufacturers support direct small-quantity ordering or sample requests.

| Component | Manufacturer finding | Private individual route | Current assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0402CS-5N6XGLW` | Coilcraft still offers the 5.6 nH `0402CS` family | Direct Buy Now / sample request | 🟡 Confirm exact `XGLW` suffix |
| `ATX-12-F-26.000MHz-F05-T` | Abracon lists exact part **Active** | Small-quantity/channel purchase or quote | 🟡 Supply-sensitive; exact MPN |
| `TC1-1-13M+` | Mini-Circuits maintains current product/support files | Direct purchase/sample request; contact sales while stock is zero | 🟡 Lead-time issue, not obsolescence |
| `2450FB15A050E` | Johanson confirms legacy-number migration to `2450FB15A0050001E`, lifecycle PROD | Mouser/DigiKey/distributor or manufacturer sample route | 🟢 Verify identity, then acceptable |
| `0896BM15E0025E` | Johanson confirms legacy-number migration to `0896BM15E0025001E`, lifecycle PROD | Mouser/DigiKey/distributor or manufacturer sample route | 🟢 Verify identity, then acceptable |
| `AT86RF215-ZU` | Microchip lists AT86RF215 **In Production** and recommended | Ordinary Microchip/distributor purchase | 🟢 |
| `RFFC5072TR13` | Qorvo lists RFFC5072 Production/Standard | Qorvo direct store or distributor | 🟢 |
| `MAAM-011229` | MACOM maintains Order / Quote / Sample / Distributor routes | Manufacturer/distributor purchase | 🟢 |

### Important correction: Coilcraft L3

The earlier report treated `0402CS-5N6XGLW` as a clear obsolete-part showstopper because Mouser marks that exact catalog entry obsolete. Coilcraft's own current catalog, however, still offers the **5.6 nH 0402CS family** and provides direct purchasing/sample facilities.

Therefore L3 is **not presently classified as a dead component**. The remaining task is to decode the historic `XGLW` suffix against Coilcraft's current tolerance/termination/packaging nomenclature and prove that the currently orderable configuration is identical to the Rev 2.8 BOM part.

### Johanson legacy MPNs

The Johanson findings are also substantially better than a normal component substitution. The manufacturer itself identifies the old CaribouLite ordering codes as legacy numbers for current global MPNs:

- `2450FB15A050(E)` → `2450FB15A0050001E`
- `0896BM15E0025(E)` → `0896BM15E0025001E`

Both current products remain in **PROD** lifecycle status and are associated with the AT86RF215 family. Before the first reproduction run, compare the legacy/current datasheets for package dimensions, pad layout, impedance, insertion loss, amplitude/phase balance and frequency response. If those are identical and Johanson confirms the numbering migration, this should be documented as an **MPN migration**, not an engineered substitute.

### Prototype procurement strategy

For a five-board first run, use three procurement paths:

1. **Eurocircuits sourcing** for ordinary passives and straightforward stocked components, while locking the exact BOM MPN.
2. **Mouser/DigiKey authorized distribution** for stocked RF, clock and silicon parts.
3. **Manufacturer-direct / customer-supplied parts** for difficult exact components such as the Abracon TCXO, Coilcraft RF inductor or Mini-Circuits balun if distributor supply is inadequate.

For the first run, Eurocircuits should receive an explicit **NO AUTOMATIC SUBSTITUTION** instruction for RF matching components, filters, baluns, transformers, oscillators/TCXOs, RF switches/amplifiers, RF215, RFFC5072 and FPGA.

## Remaining priority investigations

1. Decode Coilcraft `0402CS-5N6XGLW` and match it exactly to the current ordering system.
2. Obtain a firm source/quote for at least 5–10 exact `ATX-12-F-26.000MHz-F05-T` TCXOs.
3. Contact Mini-Circuits for availability or samples of 5–10 `TC1-1-13M+`.
4. Compare legacy/current Johanson datasheets and, ideally, obtain manufacturer confirmation of drop-in identity.
5. Re-check all remaining rows marked **Verify** against manufacturer catalogs.
6. Once these are closed, freeze a procurement BOM and request the first Eurocircuits assembly quotation.

## RF / clock parts that should be frozen to exact MPN

For the initial reproduction, the following deserve an explicit **DO NOT SUBSTITUTE** note to Eurocircuits even if their BOM tool proposes equivalents:

`0402N2R2B500CT`, `0402N1R8B500CT`, `GCM1555C1HR80WA16D`, `0402N150J500CT`, `0402N181F500CT`, `04025A8R2BAT2A`, `0402CS-5N6XGLW`, `AT86RF215-ZU`, `2450FB15A050E`, `ATX-12-F-26.000MHz-F05-T`, `0896BM15E0025E`, `MAAM-011229`, `LFCN-2250+`, `SKY13373-460LF`, `HFCN-2275+`, `CG2164X3-C2`, `CG2409X3-C2`, `TC4-19G2+`, `RFFC5072TR13`, `TC1-1-13M+`, and `SG-8018CG 125.0000M-TJHSA3`.

## Overall first-pass conclusion

The Rev 2.8 BOM looks **genuinely procurement-feasible for a five-board reproduction run**. Manufacturer-level checking has reduced several apparent distributor problems to legacy-ordering-code or temporary-stock issues rather than true obsolescence. The AT86RF215, RFFC5072, iCE40 FPGA, MACOM amplifiers, Skyworks switches, Mini-Circuits filters/transformer, regulators, EEPROM, and many passives remain obtainable. The next sourcing work should concentrate first on the obsolete Coilcraft inductor, the exact Abracon TCXO, the TC1-1-13M+ balun, the two Johanson revised MPNs, and any remaining rows marked Verify.

> Stock is time-sensitive. This document is a sourcing snapshot, not a reservation of inventory. Re-check quantities and lifecycle immediately before placing the Eurocircuits order.
